            <h2></br></br>Matho or ‘magtro’, ‘mang’ many and ‘tro’ happiness</h2>
            <p></br>The legend goes that lama Dugpa Dorje, a buddhist master of the Shakya linage
              had a vision of a deer on the hilltop near his meditation cave and that is where
              Matho monastery and village stands, since 1410. Matho village has since grown to
              300 households, mostly dependent on agriculture.
              </br></br>Friendly villagers and a vast
              expanse of barley fields and Poplar trees, surrounded by barren snowcapped
              mountains characterises the village and its habitants. Unlike many other parts of
              Ladakh, the village remains untouched by the tourist inflow due to its off the
              highway approach.
              </br></br>Matho nagrang is the annual monastic festival (April) where the
              two oracles or ‘Rongtsan’ foretell the future of harvest and climatic events based
              on which the agricultural cycles are set.

            <p><em>Film screenings:</em></br></br>
              We have weekly screenings of good art and documentary films in our Audio Visual
              room. These films are picked from a collection of rare good cinema ever produced
              and some documentaries on Ladakh, the Himalayan ecosystems and indigenous
              communities.</br></br>
              <em>Workshops:</em></br></br>
              We organise workshops (residential and day visit) on a variety of subjects like
              photography, dark room exposures, local architecture, cooking and aspects of
              organic farming. We also provide our space for schools and organisation to
              conduct offsite workshops and sessions.</br></br>
              <em>Heritage walks:</em></br></br>
              On weekdays we organise Heritage walks through the Leh old town to take our
              guests through the streets of history of this little township to know the impact of
              different cultures and civilisations that has its imprint on Ladakh and its people. On
              this walk we visit the Central Asian museum, bakers street, cultural and
              environmental organisations, local craftsman, Leh palace, Chokhang vihara and it
              ends in the main market of Leh.</br></br>
              <em>Local cooking classes:</em></br></br>
              We schedule cooking classes at the hostel for interested guests to take part in
              preparing the local cuisine of Ladakh, using herbs and vegetables plucked from
              the garden and with local pulses and Barley.</br></br>
              <em>The traveling pan:</em></br></br>
              It is always nice to have a space for travellers from around the world to bring their
              local cuisine to Hearth and share it with other travellers as a rich exchange in
              understanding different cultures and taste buds.</br></br>
              <em>Art / design / product exhibitions:</em></br></br>
              At Hearth we have a dedicated space for exhibiting art and photographs where we
              host artists (local and traveling) from time to time to showcase works on culture
              and biodiversity of the region.</br></br>
              <em>Stargazing nights:</em></br></br>
              The starry night sky in Ladakh is a treat in itself. Travellers can go to the rooftop or
              use the wood workshop space to star gaze and explore constellations we read of in
              school.</br></br>
              <em>Talks:</em></br></br>
              Ladakh has a rich cultural heritage set in a fragile ecosystem. We invite resource
              persons (local / travelling) to visit Heart hostel and share their research and stories
              on various subjects concerning the local social and ecological aspect and concerns
              of Ladakh.</br></br>
              <em>Cycling:</em></br></br>
              Hop on a cycle and ride your way into villages and valleys around Leh. Our travel
              desk rep will guide you with routes, ride hours and elevation charts for your
