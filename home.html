            <h2></br></br>Matho or ‘magtro’, ‘mang’ many and ‘tro’ happiness</h2>
            <p></br>The legend goes that lama Dugpa Dorje, a buddhist master of the Shakya linage
              had a vision of a deer on the hilltop near his meditation cave and that is where
              Matho monastery and village stands, since 1410. Matho village has since grown to
              300 households, mostly dependent on agriculture.
              </br></br>Friendly villagers and a vast
              expanse of barley fields and Poplar trees, surrounded by barren snowcapped
              mountains characterises the village and its habitants. Unlike many other parts of
              Ladakh, the village remains untouched by the tourist inflow due to its off the
              highway approach.
              </br></br>Matho nagrang is the annual monastic festival (April) where the
              two oracles or ‘Rongtsan’ foretell the future of harvest and climatic events based
              on which the agricultural cycles are set.

                around Delhi.
                </br></br><em>DAY 02: FLY TO LEH, THE CAPITAL OF LADAKH:</em>Early morning fly to Leh. The flight takes us over the Ladakh
                and Zanskar ranges. We are met at the airport and taken to the Ladakhi Style hotel.
                The rest of the day is at leisure. Leh is at an altitude of nearly 11,000ft, and you can
                expect to feel the effects of the rarefied atmosphere. For the first few hours, you
                may be a little breathless and perhaps have a slight headache. These symptoms of
                altitude sickness are mild and usually disappear quite quickly, however, everyone is
                advised to take it easy for the first day or two.
                </br></br><em>DAY 03: INDUS Valley MONASTERY TOUR (45 kms):</em> Full day visiting
                Monasteries of Ladakh - Hemis Gompa, Matho Monastery and Thiksey Gompa.
                Hemis is one of the largest and wealthiest Monasteries in Ladakh and houses
                about 150 monks; it also stages the annual Hemis festival. The Gompa, nestled in a
                gorge and surrounded by dramatic mountain scenery, was built in the 18th century
                and houses a wide range of beautiful frescoes, Thankas, Buddha statues and anexcellent library. On the way back to Leh, we visit the superbly situated, 16th
                century, Thiksey Gompa, which is perched on a hill top. The Gompa houses an
                important collection of Tibetan-style books, a huge Buddha statue and some
                excellent works of art. Overnight at farmstead in Matho.
                </br></br><em>Day 04: MATHO FARM STAY:</em> After breakfast the guests leave for Matho village to
                stay at a farm hosted by a local family. The farm is beautifully located amidst Barley
                fields and poplar tree. Explore the village around the day and enjoy the library
                there. Trek up to the Monastery in the evening and pay homage to the abode of
                the residing oracles at the Monastery.
                </br></br><em>DAY 05: MATHO TREK START:</em> Leaving early we trek up the Matho River Valley
                and set up camp after several hours' walk, at a place called Matho Phul (4,480m/
                14,700ft). After our rest in Leh and with everybody fully acclimatised, everyone
                should be fit and in good shape for the trek to base camp and climb.
                </br></br><em>DAY 06: TREK TO STOK KANGRI BASE CAMP:</em> From Matho Phul, we continue
                up the Valley making a steep climb over a pass from which we get more super
                views of Stok Kangri. Also visible below is base camp and the whole route from
                base camp to the summit can be pointed out. From here, a steady descent leads
                to our base camp and home for the next three nights (altitude approx. 5,000m/
                16,000 ft).
                </br></br><em>DAY 07: A REST DAY AND TIME FOR FINAL PREPARATIONS:</em> The expedition
                leader checks the route, while Pax do further acclamation and do short walks
                around the base camp
                </br></br><em>DAY 08: SUMMIT DAY:</em> Our summit day begins before dawn, to give us ample
                time for the climb. It is most likely that we do not need our crampons for the most
                part as we scramble over scree and boulders, which lead up to the South ridge.
                The 1,500 ft ridge that stretches up to the summit is exciting and superbly
                exposed, although never particularly steep and very straightforward. Most of the
                ridge is like a steep path, so ropes are not usually necessary, although some
                scrambling is required. At an altitude approaching 20,000ft it is extremely tiring
                and anybody who needs a rope will be able to use one. The summit is a superb
                reward for your effort, giving magnificent views in every direction. The city of Leh is
                so small that you can barely see it. After taking photographs and perhaps a bite to
                eat, we set off back down the hill. We return all the way back to base camp,. The
                evening meal is be accompanied by a wee dram to celebrate the occasion!
                </br></br><em>DAY 09: TREK TO STOK FROM BASE CAMP:</em> From base camp we trek directly
                down the Valley towards the village of Stok. This is a delightful walk, passing
                several homesteads and numerous ruins of old fortresses. We reach Stok after
                about seven hours walking, from where transport meets us and take us back to the
                farmstead in Matho.
                </br></br><em>DAY 10: FLY FROM LEH TO DELHI:</em> After another spectacular flight, we return to
                Delhi . Afternoon Guided Tour of Old Delhi, visiting Red Fort, Chandni Chowk
                ( Silver market). Overnight in hotel.

                Cultures and tame rugged landscapes of the Trans Himalayan region of Ladakh. You will
                come across Monasteries dating back to 11th century and rituals that have come down
                from generation to generation since then. With a landscape that defies all scale and a
