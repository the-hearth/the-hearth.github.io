            <h2></br></br>Matho or ‘magtro’, ‘mang’ many and ‘tro’ happiness</h2>
            <p></br>The legend goes that lama Dugpa Dorje, a buddhist master of the Shakya linage
              had a vision of a deer on the hilltop near his meditation cave and that is where
              Matho monastery and village stands, since 1410. Matho village has since grown to
              300 households, mostly dependent on agriculture.
              </br></br>Friendly villagers and a vast
              expanse of barley fields and Poplar trees, surrounded by barren snowcapped
              mountains characterises the village and its habitants. Unlike many other parts of
              Ladakh, the village remains untouched by the tourist inflow due to its off the
              highway approach.
              </br></br>Matho nagrang is the annual monastic festival (April) where the
              two oracles or ‘Rongtsan’ foretell the future of harvest and climatic events based
              on which the agricultural cycles are set.
