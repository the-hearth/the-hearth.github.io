Welcome to the farm-stay. Get involved in the day-to-day
activities of our farm.

To add new posts, visit the github storage and simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md`

Take a look at this sample post's file (it's called '2018-01-21-sample.md') on github to get an idea about how it all works...
At the top of the file, you'll find what is called the  front matter; layout, title, tags etc.
Images have been added to the 'images' folder, and then inserted by writing:
Exclamation-mark Image-description-in-square-brackets Image-url-in-round-brackets
