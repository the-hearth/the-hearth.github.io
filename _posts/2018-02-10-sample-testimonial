Welcome to the farm-stay. Get involved in the day-to-day
activities of our farm.<br/><br/>

To add new posts, visit the github storage and simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md`<br/><br/>

Take a look at this sample post's file (it's called '2018-01-21-sample-testimonial.md') on github to get an idea about how it all works...<br/><br/>
At the top of the file, you'll find what is called the  front matter; layout, title, tags etc.<br/><br/>
Images have been added to the 'images' folder, and then inserted by writing:
Exclamation-mark Image-description-in-square-brackets Image-url-in-round-brackets<br/><br/>

Text is written normally except that you will have to put break elements for line-breaks. For more advanced text editing look at this page: https://help.ghost.org/article/4-markdown-guide<br/><br/>

Copy these samples to your machine for reference abd then delete them once you've started uploading your own posts.
